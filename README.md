time-clock
==================

Assets for a song called [Time Clock](mixdowns/Time-Clock.mp3).

(Admittedly, this is in a repo mostly so that it'll show in [Observatory](https://jimkang.com/observatory).)

[On SoundCloud.](https://soundcloud.com/isilence/time-clock)

To import the song into NanoStudio, after cloning the project, zip up the contents of the .nsp-contents directory in `src` and rename it so that it has a `.nsp` file extension.
